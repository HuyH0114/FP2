# Final Project Assignment 2: Exploration (FP2)
DUE Wednesday, March 23, 2016


## My Library: racket/math (require math)
My name: Huy Huynh

For my FP2 I chose to fiddle around with the math library of racket. The math library itself is very big so I decided to focus mostly on the matrix portion of the library. There I fiddled around with the idea of converting a list into a matrix, a matrix to a list, and also the basic mathematic operators for the matrix.
